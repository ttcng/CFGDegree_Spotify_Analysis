# Tuning into Success: Song Attributes and Popularity Based on Spotify Data

## Project Introduction
The music industry is an entertaining and highly profitable industry. It is heavily reliant on streaming services such as Spotify, accounting for 67% of sales. Stakeholders, including Spotify leaders, developers, record labels, current and upcoming artists benefit from understanding trends and attributes shaping song popularity. Our project aims to contribute insights into how attributes impact song and genre popularity, deepening the understanding of music trends and addressing industry queries.

**Specific questions we aimed to answer are:** 
1. What is the correlation between song attributes and song popularity?
    - What is the relationship between these song attributes and song genre and popularity? 
2. How have different song attributes and song genre popularity changed over the past decade?
3. Is there any correlation between song attributes and the song being 'Shazamedâ€™?
